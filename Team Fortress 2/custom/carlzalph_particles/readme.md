Depri note:	
I have converted the .zips to vpks so the game can read them easier.
Also all but one of the links are dead. 
If you want to message Carl this is his steam https://steamcommunity.com/id/CarlZalph I'm not friends with him I'm simply taking his work and simplyfing it.

Choose any single vpk file.

carlzalph_particles_#.vpk 

Each one is a different Preset

Don't need all of them, just one of 'em.

INSTALLATION:

    Quit TF2 if it is open.
    Download one of the carlzalph_particles_#.vpk.
    Place the folder into:
    Team Fortress 2/tf/custom/
    Run TF2 and enjoy the reduced particles.

VERIFICATION OF INTEGRITY:
    This pack was generated with the game version listed in "Game Version.txt"
    If your game version doesn't match this because it has a higher number, then this pack might not work 100% perfectly.
    Valve could have edited any of the particles in this time.
    You can see this happening usually when either the game crashes or particles that aren't supposed to be used for something start appearing for something else.

PRESETS:

                    Screenshot URL
                Particle Burst Amount
            Particle Emission Rate
        Particle Lifetime

FAQ:
    
    1] It doesn't do anything?!
        Ensure you put the folder into the custom folder unzipped.
        Check server CVar sv_pure to see if it allows custom particles in the first place.
        You did something wrong, please don't bother me about it.

    2] Spies are harder to track with the smoke disappearing quicker than normal!  Put in a special case for it!
        Yeah they are, and no I won't.  If it bothers you so much, then go in and manually apply the edit yourself.

    3] It crashed my game!
        Please verify the integrity.  The modded particles might be out of date.
        Too many particles at once causes a client crash.  E-Mail Valve about it, please.

    4] I have no idea what I'm doing to install this!
        There are guides on the Internet to help install a mod.
        I put a simple description in here for use as a guideline.

    5] This didn't help my FPS whatsoever.
        Then you weren't bound by particle rendering.  Try looking into other possible fixes.

    6] Is this cheating?  VAC?
        Not in my definition of it, no.  It just helps performance by applying an upperbound cap.
        VAC won't do anything to this.  It's using the supported method of modification of game assets.

    7] I hate Mediafire!
        It's free.
        And if you're reading this you're on github which is also free. -depri

    8] May I post this URL somewhere?
        Go for it.

    9] May I take credit for your work?
        Absolutely not.

    10] I want a different preset!
        Accepting preset suggestions.
